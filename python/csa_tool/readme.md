## python script to run a background process, verify if the background process is running 
## output the log data if any

1. need to combine them into functions 
2. I hate UI, but this tool requires a UI . Jquery/html5/bootstrap?

##components 
run.sh - sample process to run 
run_background.py - script to execute run.sh
check_background.py - script to check if the process is still running 
readfile.py - read the output of the log after the process as completed 


## process file 

run process > check if running > read log file
